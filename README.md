# Sales-Data-Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focusing on liquor sales from 2016-2019, completed as part of my AI Coding Bootcamp. The project involves data extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization to derive insights on popular items per zip code and sales distribution among stores.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes liquor sales data, specifically:

1. Identifying the most popular liquor item in each zip code based on total bottles sold.
2. Calculating each storeâ€™s contribution to total sales as a percentage.

## Key Objectives

1. Data Extraction and Cleaning: Prepare the dataset by handling missing or inconsistent data.

2. Data Analysis: Use Python with Pandas to:
- Determine the top-selling item in each zip code.
- Calculate the percentage of total sales for each store.

3. Data Visualization: Display results using Matplotlib, including:
- A bar plot showing the top-selling item per zip code.
- A horizontal bar chart illustrating the sales percentage per store.

## Results

- Max Bottles Sold per Zip Code: The analysis reveals the most popular item in each zip code, helping identify regional preferences.
- Sales Percentage by Store: Provides insights into the revenue share among stores, highlighting top-performing locations.
